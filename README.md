The "秘乐短视频" app is a short video sharing platform designed to help the public discover interesting worlds, connect interesting worlds and people. After obtaining legal operating qualifications, it will be launched on the AppStore on March 30, 2020, during which we updated 6 Versions, accumulating more than 5 million users
# What happen?
On the morning of June 23, we received an email from Apple informing us that the App was in violation and that Apple was about to delete our developer account. We immediately replied to Apple, but the complaint ended in failure the next day, and told us to delete the developer account is the final decision.
# Our experience
In the early days, our developer account was investigated for more than a month due to insufficient preparation and insufficient understanding of AppStore audit rules. During the account survey, we also conducted an in-depth study of the AppStore audit rules, and modified the App in the next step under the guidance of the auditor. The App did not have any hidden functions, and finally we were successfully appeared on the AppStore.The reason why we have been deleted is currently unknown. We list a few possible reasons and indicate why we are doing this or what we are going to do.
## 1. In-app purchase closed
Within a few days of our project's in-app purchase recharge function, our app was maliciously refunded by others with improper means, resulting in our loss of millions in a few days, so we chose to temporarily close in-app purchases to optimize us Recharge process.

## 2. Comment
When we accumulated a large number of users, we received malicious attacks from various competitors similar to malicious appraisals of our App in the App Store, and our operations department also explained this on our fan platform.  And then we found that some faithful and spontaneous comments on our APP in the App Store to help us explain to other users. I don't know whether these actions have affected us.
## 3. Lawyer Letter
We received an attorney letter from Beijing Weibo Vision Technology Co., Ltd. at the same time when we received the APP removal on 6.23. The attorney letter mentioned that we were suspected of imitating the Douyin short video application for unfair competition, and It is pointed out that we have several pages that are similar to the short video of their APP "抖音", which infringes on them and gives us 3 days to rectify the relevant UI. Although this is not our original intention and we also have related files such as soft works of our APP, we still take this incident very seriously and decided to rectify the relevant pages immediately to eliminate their misunderstandings and troubles.
Here are some of the design drawings we are modifying:

# How we feel
As a startup company. At the beginning of our establishment, we just encountered the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic, and then the internal purchase of our App was maliciously refunded by others with improper means. Although these difficulties have caused us tremendous pressure, but these difficulties have never stopped the progress of our entire team, we have always been confident and determined to make an excellent product. But this time the arbitrary removal of APP made us feel desperate.
Could you please tell us the specific reason? If you have any resources that could help, we appreciate if you contact me with: Email: 654070281@qq.com Phone: +86 18626869915. Apple ID of our App: 1493148811. Thank You!
